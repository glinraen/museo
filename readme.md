# Project 2 - Museo! A Full-stack application

## Description

This project is currently an index of Museums in San Francisco. The user can search for Museum by Specialty, as well add, view, edit and delete museum records. Each museum record has a name, image url, description, website link and a specialty(category).

My user stories and a link to wireframes can be found at my Trello project folder:

Planned additional features include the addition of other locations for Museums, besides San Franscisco, for example: other major metropolitan cities, and a tag cloud for categories on the index page.

## Motivation

I created this project for a class assignment. There are many different and interesting types of museums in San Francisco, and in the world, and I wanted an easy way for users browse and to find a museum based on their interest/s or to find something new and interesting.
